I am a software engineer interested in backend systems, developer experience, programming language design, database internals, and computer science education.

In my spare time, I enjoy biking, gardening, hiking, listening to jazz, and handiwork/DIY. <!--You can read about those and my other interests <a href="/posts">here</a>.-->

You can connect with me via [GitHub](https://github.com/gondek/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexgondek/), or by email at [alexgondek@gmail.com](mailto:alexgondek@gmail.com). <small class="social-media-note">(I am not on any social media)</small>
